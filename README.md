The Snake Game Because Why Not?

Only Works for Non-Windows. The import Curses is for nonwindows. 

Not to hard and interesting to learn to do. Could use a little more functionality for high scores and the like but it works. Shoutout to Engineering man for the tutorial. Needed to fix a bit for some bugs but good either way.
